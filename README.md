# Ender-3-Plotter
## 📌 About

Ender-3-Plotter is an open-source project aiming to convert a Creality Ender 3 into a 2D plotter for drawing, sketching, and printing blueprints.

Instead of buying an expensive plotter, the goal is to reuse as many original parts of the printer as possible to create a low-cost and accessible solution.

This project is fully open-source to give back to the community that helped me learn and experiment.

## 🎯 Motivation

I wanted a 2D plotter to easily draw blueprints and technical sketches.
After seeing the price of commercial plotters, I decided to rebuild my Ender 3 into a plotter instead.

I also want this project to be open-source so anyone can build, modify, or improve it.

## ✅ Objectives

- Build a functional 2D plotter

- Keep the cost as low as possible

- Make the project reproducible by others

- Document everything

## ⚙️ Constraints

- Use as few additional printed parts as possible

- Reuse as many original Ender 3 parts as possible

- Keep modifications reversible if possible

## 🛠️ Planned Steps (To-Do)

- Disassemble an old Ender 3

- Identify reusable parts

- Take measurements

- Design 3D parts

- Print and/or cut parts

- Assemble the plotter

- Test and calibrate

- Document the build

## 📂 Future Content

- STL / STEP files

- Wiring diagrams

- Firmware configuration

- Assembly guide

- Bill of Materials (BOM)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project has not started yet.
The repository will be updated as soon as development begins.
